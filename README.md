# Qolab
A quantum open-science collaboration environment

# Project Description
As part of QWorld's [QJam 2021](https://qworld.net/qjam2021/) 
Based on the talk [An environment to evolve collective explanations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpgHSbndExo) by Xavier Coiteux-Roy and his original [blog entry](https://cqi.inf.usi.ch/blog/three.html). The idea is to create a proof of concept of an open-science collaboration environment that allows users to collectively evolve the understanding of an article or topic, particularly on Quantum Computing.

# Motivation and Novelty factor
Scientific work revolves around papers and articles, and there are already platforms that allow to archive and distribute them, but they're not so good for collaboration and the evolution of ideas and understanding. The novelty of this project resides on the fact that collaboration and collective knowledge is at its core, allowing students to get a faster and deeper understanding on difficult topics, such as Quantum Computing.

# Target Outcome
The deliverable will be a proof of concept of the main ideas behind the project motivation. A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that can be tested and feedback gathered, so the product can be enhanced on future iterations by either the same team or others.
  
# Build and Run
